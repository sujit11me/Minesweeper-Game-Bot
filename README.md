# Minesweeper-Game-Bot
This is a Minesweeper Bot, that uses automatic mouse click to play the game. The code Only works on https://minesweeperonline.com/ in Google Chrome with a 720p monitor.
I have upload 2 screenshots of how to adjust the browser before running the code.
First, player have to click a random cell before pressing the run button.
At a point, the script may completed it execution, but the game is not completed. At this point, player has to click on a cell (not random) and run the script again.

Working principle: It checks numbers on a cells and open and unopened cells around that number and clicks accordingly.
