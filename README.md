# Minesweeper-Game-Bot
This is a Minesweeper Bot, that uses automatic mouse click to play the game. The code Only works on https://minesweeperonline.com/ in Google Chrome with a 720p monitor.
I used Spyder to run my script.
I have upload some screenshots showing how to adjust the browser before running the code.
First, player have to click a random cell before pressing the run button.
At a point, the script may completed it execution, but the game is not completed. At this point, player has to click on a unopened cell (not random) and run the script again.

Screenshot 1 showing how to adjust the browser before clicking any cell in minesweeper.
Screenshot 2 showing a random click before running the script.
Screenshot 3, 4 showing some failures.
Screenshot 5, 6, 7 showing success.

Working principle of the bot: It checks numbers on opened cells and open and unopened cells around that number and clicks accordingly.
